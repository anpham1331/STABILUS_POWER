# STABILUS_POWER
This repo contains an arduino source file along with a supplmentary python file

The arduino source file can be uploaded to an arduino mega as normal and does not need the python file. The python file, when ran, displays a separate serial monitor for visual purposes, otherwise all serial lines printed can be used on any serial monitor when the arduino code is ran.

Original source code in this repo was written and provided by Anthony Pham (apham18@charlotte.edu) of the STABILUS_POWER team.
